## Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain 

- Record a short video or take screenshots as evidence of your deployed crowdsale contract. The video or screenshots should illustrate the following: 
    - Deployment of the contract to a local blockchain with Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
    - Using test accounts to buy new tokens from the crowdsale and then checking the balances associated with the test accounts.
    - After purchasing tokens with test accounts, viewing the total supply of minted tokens and the amount of wei that has been raised by the crowdsale.
